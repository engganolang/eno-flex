## The exported .lift data from FLEx `Lexicon`


The latest, exported `Lexicon` data (pre- and post-October-2023 fieldwork) contains some example sentences for certain lexical entries. This leads to the presence of duplicated observation in `FLEX-lift-pre-fieldwork.rds` (read into R as `lu_form_df` tibble). The examples are contained in the `"x_eno"`, `"x_idn"`, and `"x_eng"` columns of `lu_form_df`.

Even though the `x_...` columns have been excluded and then the `distinct()` function has been run, there are still duplicates due to the presence of multiple senses of a given lexical entry. These multiple senses (shown in the `"sense_gloss_en"` and/or `"sense_gloss_idn"` column of the `lu_form_df` tibble) are represented into different rows. The example is *ueh* that is glossed as 'sleep' and 'lie'. Hence, *ueh* has two entries/rows in `lu_form_df`.

The following code shows how to get the entries that are duplicated due to having more than one sense/gloss.

```{r get-duplicated-entries, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
duplicated_entries <- lu_form_df |> 
  
  # exclude the example sentences column
  select(!matches("^x_")) |> 
  
  # get distinct observation
  distinct() |> 
  
  # count the number of entry_id, showing there are duplicated entries, still.
  count(entry_id, sort = TRUE)

duplicated_entries
```


The following code shows preview of entries with multiple senses.

```{r show-duplicated-entries}
lu_form_df |> 
  
  # From the `duplicated_entries` tibble above,
  # filter only `"entry_id"` column whose occurrences are more than once,
  # suggesting that such entry has more than one sense/gloss.
  filter(entry_id %in% pull(filter(duplicated_entries, n > 1),
                            entry_id)) |> 
  
  # Print the relevant columns
  select(entry_id, form, sense_order, sense_gloss_en, sense_gloss_idn)
```
