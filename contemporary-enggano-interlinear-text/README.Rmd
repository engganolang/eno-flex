# Code file for processing the exported .lift data from FLEx `Lexicon`

The code file to process the .lift export from FLEx `Lexicon` is [FLEX-contemporary-with-examples-new.R](https://github.com/engganolang/eno-flex/blob/main/FLEX-contemporary-with-examples-new.R). This code file is the basis for the following output data, namely:

1. "`FLEX-lift-pre-fieldwork.rds`" (as per 2023)

1. "`FLEX-lift-march-2024.rds`" (as per March 2024 project meeting at Udayana University)

# Code files for processing the exported .flextext data from FLEx interlinear text in `Texts and Words`

The codes to process the .flextext export data need to be run in the order given below. However, before these codes are run, I need to fix anomaly in the .flextext output based on the notes given in [all-contemp-interlinear-texts-NOTES.txt](https://github.com/engganolang/eno-flex/blob/main/contemporary-enggano-interlinear-text/all-contemp-interlinear-texts-NOTES.txt).

(@flextext-code-1) [processing-all-contemporary-texts-ELAN-FLEX-flextext-NEW.R](https://github.com/engganolang/eno-flex/blob/main/contemporary-enggano-interlinear-text/processing-all-contemporary-texts-ELAN-FLEX-flextext-NEW.R)

**Description** : This code file in [(@flextext-code-1)](https://github.com/engganolang/eno-flex/blob/main/contemporary-enggano-interlinear-text/processing-all-contemporary-texts-ELAN-FLEX-flextext-NEW.R) processes the .flextext data for the natural language corpus (see the `A. Natural texts` section in the code) and elicitation materials (see the `B. Elicitation` section in the code).

**Input data**: 

- The input file for the natural corpus is "`contemporary-enggano-interlinear-text/all-contemp-texts-with-idn-gloss-march2024.flextext`" (for the March Project Meeting 2024 version) and "`contemporary-enggano-interlinear-text/all-contemp-texts-with-idn-gloss.flextext`" (for the older, post first fieldwork version in late 2023). 

- The input file for the elicitation data is "`contemporary-enggano-interlinear-text/all-contemp-elicitation-march2024.flextext`" (for the March Project Meeting 2024 version) and "`contemporary-enggano-interlinear-text/all-contemp-elicitation.flextext`" (for the older, post first fieldwork version in late 2023). 

**Output data**: The codes in [(@flextext-code-1)](https://github.com/engganolang/eno-flex/blob/main/contemporary-enggano-interlinear-text/processing-all-contemporary-texts-ELAN-FLEX-flextext-NEW.R) generates the output data in .rds. 

- The first is .rds file for the original texts and their English and Indonesian translation in tibble format (the combined/binded one from the list version appears in "`contemporary-enggano-interlinear-text/eno_contemp_text_only_as_tibble-new-binded-march2024.rds`" for the natural corpus and in "`contemporary-enggano-interlinear-text/eno_contemp_elicitation_only_as_tibble-new-binded-march2024.rds`" for the elicitation). 

- The second .rds data generated by [(@flextext-code-1)](https://github.com/engganolang/eno-flex/blob/main/contemporary-enggano-interlinear-text/processing-all-contemporary-texts-ELAN-FLEX-flextext-NEW.R) is for the words/lexicon (generated via the for-loop in the code file); this data appears as tibbles in "`contemporary-enggano-interlinear-text/eno_contemp_text_as_tibble-new-march2024.rds`" for the natural corpus and in "`contemporary-enggano-interlinear-text/eno_contemp_elicitation_as_tibble-new-march2024.rds`" for the elicitation.

# The exported .lift data from FLEx `Lexicon`

The latest, exported `Lexicon` data based on the code file [FLEX-contemporary-with-examples-new.R](https://github.com/engganolang/eno-flex/blob/main/FLEX-contemporary-with-examples-new.R) (pre- and post-October-2023 fieldwork called `FLEX-lift-pre-fieldwork.rds`, or the March 2024 version called `FLEX-lift-march-2024.rds`) contains some example sentences for certain lexical entries. This leads to the presence of duplicated observation in `FLEX-lift-pre-fieldwork.rds`/`FLEX-lift-march-2024.rds` (to be read into R as `lu_form_df` tibble). The example sentences are contained in the `"x_eno"`, `"x_idn"`, and `"x_eng"` columns of the `lu_form_df`.

Even though the `x_...` columns for example sentences have been excluded and then the `distinct()` function has been run, there are still duplicates due to the presence of multiple senses of a given lexical entry. These multiple senses (shown in the `"sense_gloss_en"` and/or `"sense_gloss_idn"` column of the `lu_form_df` tibble) are represented into different rows. The example is *ueh* that is glossed as 'sleep' and 'lie'. Hence, *ueh* has two entries/rows in `lu_form_df`.

The following code shows how to get the entries that are duplicated due to having more than one sense/gloss.

```{r get-duplicated-entries, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
duplicated_entries <- lu_form_df |> 
  
  # exclude the example sentences column
  select(!matches("^x_")) |> 
  
  # get distinct observation
  distinct() |> 
  
  # count the number of entry_id, showing there are duplicated entries, still.
  count(entry_id, sort = TRUE)

duplicated_entries
```


The following code shows preview of entries with multiple senses.

```{r show-duplicated-entries}
lu_form_df |> 
  
  # From the `duplicated_entries` tibble above,
  # filter only `"entry_id"` column whose occurrences are more than once,
  # suggesting that such entry has more than one sense/gloss.
  filter(entry_id %in% pull(filter(duplicated_entries, n > 1),
                            entry_id)) |> 
  
  # Print the relevant columns
  select(entry_id, form, sense_order, sense_gloss_en, sense_gloss_idn)
```


# On the "eno_word_id" value

- IMPORTANT: The same word form may have different `eno_word_id` because this same word form comes from different texts!

- For example, the word "kapa'ueh" 'put; lay down' has three unique IDs because these three IDs are coming from three different texts for this one word.

# Textbook materials

This section contains my notes to process the textbook-based print dictionary from the .flextext and .lift outputs.

The R packages used are tidyverse, xml2, and stringi

- IMPORTANT: Ensure in FLEx gloss tab that the writing system keyboard in each free translation field is a match!

    - If this is not the case, the use of English keyboard in Indonesian field will render the language element of the .flextext output as "en" for this Indonesian field.

## Processing steps

The very first steps among others are exporting (i) the .flextext file from FLEx Analyze tab in TEXTS AND WORDS and (ii) the .lift file from FLEx LEXICON feature.

The latest exported files from these two components of FLEx that are used for the print dictionary are:

- `textbook/textbook-interlinear-20241201.flextext`

- `textbook/textbook-LIFT-20241201.lift`

[TO BE UPDATED: how to handle FLORA and FAUNA, and CULTURAL DATA for photos]

### Processing the exported .flextext data for the Textbook

#### Input data

The input data file is `textbook/textbook-interlinear-20241201.flextext`.

#### Code file/bits

The R codes used are under the [`C. Textbooks` section](https://github.com/engganolang/eno-flex/blob/ffd88cebe419b1f9546700a0fa563113a16d985b/contemporary-enggano-interlinear-text/processing-all-contemporary-texts-ELAN-FLEX-flextext-NEW.R#L672) in the code file [`contemporary-enggano-interlinear-text/processing-all-contemporary-texts-ELAN-FLEX-flextext-NEW.R`](https://github.com/engganolang/eno-flex/blob/main/contemporary-enggano-interlinear-text/processing-all-contemporary-texts-ELAN-FLEX-flextext-NEW.R)`.

#### Output/generated file/data

There are several outputs of data stored under the `textbook` sub-directory (included in the filename of the generated data below for expository purpose):

- **textbook/textbook_as_tibble_20241201.rds**. It contains the Enggano texts and free translations in English and Indonesian, and the source/reference information. This is an R list of data frames/tibbles per text title. (the latest data to use before importing into FLEx whereby I performed further manual on-the-spot post-processing in the newly imported FLEx project)

- **textbook/textbook_as_tibble_20241201-binded.rds**. It is the binded combined version of **textbook/textbook_as_tibble_20241201.rds** into a tibble data. (the latest data to use before importing into FLEx whereby I performed further manual on-the-spot post-processing in the newly imported FLEx project)

- ~~**contemporary-enggano-interlinear-text/textbook_lexicon_as_tibble_oct-2024.rds**~~ **textbook/textbook_lexicon_as_tibble_20241201.rds**. This is a tibble of interlinearised morpheme-by-morpheme analyses (the latest data to use before importing into FLEx whereby I performed further manual on-the-spot post-processing in the newly imported FLEx project)


### Processing the exported .lift data

#### Input data

The input data file is `textbook/textbook-LIFT-20241201.lift`.

#### Code file/bits

The R code used is [`contemporary-enggano-interlinear-text/textbook-LIFT-processing-code.R`](https://github.com/engganolang/eno-flex/blob/main/contemporary-enggano-interlinear-text/textbook-LIFT-processing-code.R).

#### Output/generated file/data

The main output file from processing the .lift file is called **textbook/textbook-LIFT-20241201.rds**.

### Processing into Standard Format Marker (SFM) file

#### Input data

The input data uses the generated data from the previous two steps (plus data from FLORA and FAUNA [Details to be updated]).

#### Code file/bits

There are two main codes:

a. [contemporary-enggano-interlinear-text/textbook-splitting-code.R](https://github.com/engganolang/eno-flex/blob/main/contemporary-enggano-interlinear-text/textbook-splitting-code.R). This code file split the combined morphemes into their own entry/row for tidy data format. The input data for this code is `textbook/textbook_lexicon_as_tibble_20241201.rds`. This first code file is internally called from the second code below.

a. [contemporary-enggano-interlinear-text/textbook-SFM.R](https://github.com/engganolang/eno-flex/blob/main/contemporary-enggano-interlinear-text/textbook-SFM.R). This code file calls the [contemporary-enggano-interlinear-text/textbook-splitting-code.R](https://github.com/engganolang/eno-flex/blob/main/contemporary-enggano-interlinear-text/textbook-splitting-code.R). The input data for this second code are as follows:

    - `textbook/textbook-LIFT-20241201.rds` (the output of .lift processing)
    
    - `textbook/textbook_as_tibble_20241201-binded.rds` (the Enggano phrase/text and its free English and Indonesian translations)
    
    - Flora and Fauna data [To be updated!!!]

#### Output/generated file/data

The main output is an SFM data in .db extension, namely **textbook/textbook-dictionary-20241213-no-example-for-same-phrase.db**.

This SFM data is imported into a new FLEx project for the printed dictionary. There are several manual post-editing of the entries directly in FLEx. There are several notes in the NOTEBOOK feature of this FLEx project recording such processes. Also, I manually added several cultural items and tools for the subentries into FLEx directly, while some other pictures (esp. FLORA and FAUNA, and the pictures of root forms of the Cultural Lexicon data) are directly linked through coding in the [contemporary-enggano-interlinear-text/textbook-SFM.R](https://github.com/engganolang/eno-flex/blob/main/contemporary-enggano-interlinear-text/textbook-SFM.R).
    
## On importing to FLEx

This note records entry to merge between FLORA & FAUNA data, Cultural Items data, and Textbook materials. The SFM of FLORA & FAUNA is separately processed from Cultural Items + Textbook materials. **UPDATE: 17 Dec 2024**; this manual merging is no longer needed as the FLORA and FAUNA data are processed together with the textbook materials.

1. bahem

1. Bakaor

NOTE : for this section, it has been fixed in the R code (esp. in `textbook-splitting-code.R`) where I identified a variable for grouping words as complex forms when the morph_gloss_en contains `__`, which I use as a separator for morpheme-by-morpheme glossing of the complex forms. So, if words have these morpheme structures, they are treated as subentries of the root (to distinguish them with variant)





# On sub-entries

## Sub-entries type

1. The SFM can include custom marker indicating the specific type of the sub-entries.

1. In the new FLEx project, set up the corresponding specific sub-entry types in the List for "Complex Form Types".

    1. This specific sub-entry type is given in the Name and Abbreviation fields.
    
    1. The Reverse Name and Reverse Abbr. of the specific sub-entry type is also prepared in the FLEx List.
    
1. Finally, in the mapping during import, I will only specify the specific sub-entry types with the custom marker, without the need to create marker for the Reverse Name and Reverse Abbr.

1. __TO DO (DONE)__: prepare the list of the relevant complex form types for matching between SFM Marker and FLEx List. (DONE)
