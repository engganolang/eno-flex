## Code file for processing the exported .lift data from FLEx `Lexicon`

The code file to process the .lift export from FLEx `Lexicon` is [FLEX-contemporary-with-examples-new.R](https://github.com/engganolang/eno-flex/blob/main/FLEX-contemporary-with-examples-new.R). This code file is the basis for the following output data, namely:

1. "`FLEX-lift-pre-fieldwork.rds`" (as per 2023)

1. "`FLEX-lift-march-2024.rds`" (as per March 2024 project meeting at Udayana University)

## Code files for processing the exported .flextext data from FLEx interlinear text in `Texts and Words`

The codes to process the .flextext export data need to be run in the order given below. However, before these codes are run, I need to fix anomaly in the .flextext output based on the notes given in [all-contemp-interlinear-texts-NOTES.txt](https://github.com/engganolang/eno-flex/blob/main/contemporary-enggano-interlinear-text/all-contemp-interlinear-texts-NOTES.txt).

(@flextext-code-1) [processing-all-contemporary-texts-ELAN-FLEX-flextext-NEW.R](https://github.com/engganolang/eno-flex/blob/main/contemporary-enggano-interlinear-text/processing-all-contemporary-texts-ELAN-FLEX-flextext-NEW.R)

**Description** : This code file in [(@flextext-code-1)](https://github.com/engganolang/eno-flex/blob/main/contemporary-enggano-interlinear-text/processing-all-contemporary-texts-ELAN-FLEX-flextext-NEW.R) processes the .flextext data for the natural language corpus (see the `A. Natural texts` section in the code) and elicitation materials (see the `B. Elicitation` section in the code).

**Input data**: 

- The input file for the natural corpus is "`contemporary-enggano-interlinear-text/all-contemp-texts-with-idn-gloss-march2024.flextext`" (for the March Project Meeting 2024 version) and "`contemporary-enggano-interlinear-text/all-contemp-texts-with-idn-gloss.flextext`" (for the older, post first fieldwork version in late 2023). 

- The input file for the elicitation data is "`contemporary-enggano-interlinear-text/all-contemp-elicitation-march2024.flextext`" (for the March Project Meeting 2024 version) and "`contemporary-enggano-interlinear-text/all-contemp-elicitation.flextext`" (for the older, post first fieldwork version in late 2023). 

**Output data**: The codes in [(@flextext-code-1)](https://github.com/engganolang/eno-flex/blob/main/contemporary-enggano-interlinear-text/processing-all-contemporary-texts-ELAN-FLEX-flextext-NEW.R) generates the output data in .rds. 

- The first is .rds file for the original texts and their English and Indonesian translation in tibble format (the combined/binded one from the list version appears in "`contemporary-enggano-interlinear-text/eno_contemp_text_only_as_tibble-new-binded-march2024.rds`" for the natural corpus and in "`contemporary-enggano-interlinear-text/eno_contemp_elicitation_only_as_tibble-new-binded-march2024.rds`" for the elicitation). 

- The second .rds data generated by [(@flextext-code-1)](https://github.com/engganolang/eno-flex/blob/main/contemporary-enggano-interlinear-text/processing-all-contemporary-texts-ELAN-FLEX-flextext-NEW.R) is for the words/lexicon (generated via the for-loop in the code file); this data appears as tibbles in "`contemporary-enggano-interlinear-text/eno_contemp_text_as_tibble-new-march2024.rds`" for the natural corpus and in "`contemporary-enggano-interlinear-text/eno_contemp_elicitation_as_tibble-new-march2024.rds`" for the elicitation.

## The exported .lift data from FLEx `Lexicon`


The latest, exported `Lexicon` data based on the code file [FLEX-contemporary-with-examples-new.R](https://github.com/engganolang/eno-flex/blob/main/FLEX-contemporary-with-examples-new.R) (pre- and post-October-2023 fieldwork called `FLEX-lift-pre-fieldwork.rds`, or the March 2024 version called `FLEX-lift-march-2024.rds`) contains some example sentences for certain lexical entries. This leads to the presence of duplicated observation in `FLEX-lift-pre-fieldwork.rds`/`FLEX-lift-march-2024.rds` (to be read into R as `lu_form_df` tibble). The example sentences are contained in the `"x_eno"`, `"x_idn"`, and `"x_eng"` columns of the `lu_form_df`.

Even though the `x_...` columns for example sentences have been excluded and then the `distinct()` function has been run, there are still duplicates due to the presence of multiple senses of a given lexical entry. These multiple senses (shown in the `"sense_gloss_en"` and/or `"sense_gloss_idn"` column of the `lu_form_df` tibble) are represented into different rows. The example is *ueh* that is glossed as 'sleep' and 'lie'. Hence, *ueh* has two entries/rows in `lu_form_df`.

The following code shows how to get the entries that are duplicated due to having more than one sense/gloss.

```{r get-duplicated-entries, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
duplicated_entries <- lu_form_df |> 
  
  # exclude the example sentences column
  select(!matches("^x_")) |> 
  
  # get distinct observation
  distinct() |> 
  
  # count the number of entry_id, showing there are duplicated entries, still.
  count(entry_id, sort = TRUE)

duplicated_entries
```


The following code shows preview of entries with multiple senses.

```{r show-duplicated-entries}
lu_form_df |> 
  
  # From the `duplicated_entries` tibble above,
  # filter only `"entry_id"` column whose occurrences are more than once,
  # suggesting that such entry has more than one sense/gloss.
  filter(entry_id %in% pull(filter(duplicated_entries, n > 1),
                            entry_id)) |> 
  
  # Print the relevant columns
  select(entry_id, form, sense_order, sense_gloss_en, sense_gloss_idn)
```


## On sub-entries

### Sub-entries type

1. The SFM can include custom marker indicating the specific type of the sub-entries.

1. In the new FLEx project, set up the corresponding specific sub-entry types in the List for "Complex Form Types".

    1. This specific sub-entry type is given in the Name and Abbreviation fields.
    
    1. The Reverse Name and Reverse Abbr. of the specific sub-entry type is also prepared in the FLEx List.
    
1. Finally, in the mapping during import, I will only specify the specific sub-entry types with the custom marker, without the need to create marker for the Reverse Name and Reverse Abbr.

1. __TO DO__: prepare the list of the relevant complex form types for matching between SFM Marker and FLEx List.
