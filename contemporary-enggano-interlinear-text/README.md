## Code file for processing the exported .lift data from FLEx `Lexicon`

The code file to process the .lift export from FLEx `Lexicon` is
[FLEX-contemporary-with-examples-new.R](https://github.com/engganolang/eno-flex/blob/main/FLEX-contemporary-with-examples-new.R).
This code file is the basis for the following output data, namely:

1.  “`FLEX-lift-pre-fieldwork.rds`” (as per 2023)

2.  “`FLEX-lift-march-2024.rds`” (as per March 2024 project meeting at
    Udayana University)

## Code files for processing the exported .flextext data from FLEx interlinear text in `Texts and Words`

The codes to process the .flextext export data need to be run in the
order given below. However, before these codes are run, I need to fix
anomaly in the .flextext output based on the notes given in
[all-contemp-interlinear-texts-NOTES.txt](https://github.com/engganolang/eno-flex/blob/main/contemporary-enggano-interlinear-text/all-contemp-interlinear-texts-NOTES.txt).

1)  [processing-all-contemporary-texts-ELAN-FLEX-flextext-NEW.R](https://github.com/engganolang/eno-flex/blob/main/contemporary-enggano-interlinear-text/processing-all-contemporary-texts-ELAN-FLEX-flextext-NEW.R)

**Description** : This code file in
[(1)](https://github.com/engganolang/eno-flex/blob/main/contemporary-enggano-interlinear-text/processing-all-contemporary-texts-ELAN-FLEX-flextext-NEW.R)
processes the .flextext data for the natural language corpus (see the
`A. Natural texts` section in the code) and elicitation materials (see
the `B. Elicitation` section in the code).

**Input data**:

- The input file for the natural corpus is
  “`contemporary-enggano-interlinear-text/all-contemp-texts-with-idn-gloss-march2024.flextext`”
  (for the March Project Meeting 2024 version) and
  “`contemporary-enggano-interlinear-text/all-contemp-texts-with-idn-gloss.flextext`”
  (for the older, post first fieldwork version in late 2023).

- The input file for the elicitation data is
  “`contemporary-enggano-interlinear-text/all-contemp-elicitation-march2024.flextext`”
  (for the March Project Meeting 2024 version) and
  “`contemporary-enggano-interlinear-text/all-contemp-elicitation.flextext`”
  (for the older, post first fieldwork version in late 2023).

**Output data**: The codes in
[(1)](https://github.com/engganolang/eno-flex/blob/main/contemporary-enggano-interlinear-text/processing-all-contemporary-texts-ELAN-FLEX-flextext-NEW.R)
generates the output data in .rds.

- The first is .rds file for the original texts and their English and
  Indonesian translation in tibble format (the combined/binded one from
  the list version appears in
  “`contemporary-enggano-interlinear-text/eno_contemp_text_only_as_tibble-new-binded-march2024.rds`”
  for the natural corpus and in
  “`contemporary-enggano-interlinear-text/eno_contemp_elicitation_only_as_tibble-new-binded-march2024.rds`”
  for the elicitation).

- The second .rds data generated by
  [(1)](https://github.com/engganolang/eno-flex/blob/main/contemporary-enggano-interlinear-text/processing-all-contemporary-texts-ELAN-FLEX-flextext-NEW.R)
  is for the words/lexicon (generated via the for-loop in the code
  file); this data appears as tibbles in
  “`contemporary-enggano-interlinear-text/eno_contemp_text_as_tibble-new-march2024.rds`”
  for the natural corpus and in
  “`contemporary-enggano-interlinear-text/eno_contemp_elicitation_as_tibble-new-march2024.rds`”
  for the elicitation.

    (NB. from within this code, we call the following two codes:
    [processing-all-contemporary-texts-ELAN-FLEX-flextext-NEW-splitting-morpheme.R](https://github.com/engganolang/eno-flex/blob/main/contemporary-enggano-interlinear-text/processing-all-contemporary-texts-ELAN-FLEX-flextext-NEW-splitting-morpheme.R)

## The exported .lift data from FLEx `Lexicon`

The latest, exported `Lexicon` data based on the code file
[FLEX-contemporary-with-examples-new.R](https://github.com/engganolang/eno-flex/blob/main/FLEX-contemporary-with-examples-new.R)
(pre- and post-October-2023 fieldwork called
`FLEX-lift-pre-fieldwork.rds`, or the March 2024 version called
`FLEX-lift-march-2024.rds`) contains some example sentences for certain
lexical entries. This leads to the presence of duplicated observation in
`FLEX-lift-pre-fieldwork.rds`/`FLEX-lift-march-2024.rds` (to be read
into R as `lu_form_df` tibble). The example sentences are contained in
the `"x_eno"`, `"x_idn"`, and `"x_eng"` columns of the `lu_form_df`.

Even though the `x_...` columns for example sentences have been excluded
and then the `distinct()` function has been run, there are still
duplicates due to the presence of multiple senses of a given lexical
entry. These multiple senses (shown in the `"sense_gloss_en"` and/or
`"sense_gloss_idn"` column of the `lu_form_df` tibble) are represented
into different rows. The example is *ueh* that is glossed as ‘sleep’ and
‘lie’. Hence, *ueh* has two entries/rows in `lu_form_df`.

The following code shows how to get the entries that are duplicated due
to having more than one sense/gloss.

``` r
duplicated_entries <- lu_form_df |> 
  
  # exclude the example sentences column
  select(!matches("^x_")) |> 
  
  # get distinct observation
  distinct() |> 
  
  # count the number of entry_id, showing there are duplicated entries, still.
  count(entry_id, sort = TRUE)

duplicated_entries
#> # A tibble: 1,498 × 2
#>    entry_id                                 n

```

The following code shows preview of entries with multiple senses.

``` r
lu_form_df |> 
  
  # From the `duplicated_entries` tibble above,
  # filter only `"entry_id"` column whose occurrences are more than once,
  # suggesting that such entry has more than one sense/gloss.
  filter(entry_id %in% pull(filter(duplicated_entries, n > 1),
                            entry_id)) |> 
  
  # Print the relevant columns
  select(entry_id, form, sense_order, sense_gloss_en, sense_gloss_idn)
#> # A tibble: 121 × 5
#>    entry_id                     form  sense_order sense_gloss_en sense_gloss_idn

## On sub-entries

### Sub-entries type

1.  The SFM can include custom marker indicating the specific type of
    the sub-entries.

2.  In the new FLEx project, set up the corresponding specific sub-entry
    types in the List for “Complex Form Types”.

    1.  This specific sub-entry type is given in the Name and
        Abbreviation fields.

    2.  The Reverse Name and Reverse Abbr. of the specific sub-entry
        type is also prepared in the FLEx List.

3.  Finally, in the mapping during import, I will only specify the
    specific sub-entry types with the custom marker, without the need to
    create marker for the Reverse Name and Reverse Abbr.

4.  **TO DO**: prepare the list of the relevant complex form types for
    matching between SFM Marker and FLEx List.
