# Overview

This sub-directory contains the .flextext files that are exported from FLEx "Texts & Words" feature, especially from the "Analyze" interface of the "Interlinear Texts" feature.

These .flextext files are then wrangled using R into tabular format (from XML format) for generating one final output: 

1. Tabular format for web- and mobile-based dictionary

This custom wrangling allows computational, automatic linking between lexical entry/root, complex form/derivatives, example sentences, and all their glosses.

Ideally, when working in FLEx software, linking a complex form in the lexicon with its root needs to be done manually by telling FLEx (via GUI) that certain form is a complex form of a root, etc.
