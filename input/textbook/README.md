# Overview

This sub-directory contains the exported data from FLEx (i) "Analyze" tab of the interlinearised texts (as a .flextext stored under the "interlinear" sub-directory) and (ii) LEXICON interface (as .lift file under the "lift" sub-directory).

This sub-directory is only used for materials for the printed dictionary accompanying the textbooks.

The output of processing this textbook-related, printed-dictionary will be combined with the "contemporary" inputs (texts and elicitations) for the purpose of the digital web- and mobile-based dictionary.
