## Description

This repository records the R codes I use to process the LIFT output of
FLEx Lexicon and integrate it with the .flextext output of the
interlinear texts to build the SFM format to be imported back to FLEx.

These processings are needed to automate the linking between the root
and the complex forms (as subentries of the roots), including adding the
example sentences and source references of these examples.
